### A Comparison of Statistical Distributions of SDSS Galaxies to a Randomly Generated Patch of the Universe (Python)

Generated multiple random variance samples with predictive modeling in the density of galaxies (Monte Carlo method) from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and compared; Found the variance of the SDSS galaxy number density was 2.2 higher than that of a randomly generated set of galaxies; Suggested that the Universe is not random, tends to be cluster
